# Faster Melee v4.4 Installer for Linux

Script for compiling Faster Melee v4.4 on Linux! FULLY Tested on Ubuntu 16.10 (including netplay this time).

##Dependencies needed (install these first!)
See [this page](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=Building_Dolphin_on_Linux) for what exactly your distro needs!

In general, you need g++ (version >= 4.9), git, cmake, make, libopenal, and libsoundtouch!

##To use:

```bash
curl -LO "https://github.com/Ptomerty/FasterMelee-installer/raw/master/setup"
bash setup
```

##Changelog
v1.3~reg1: Final version, attempting to avoid cloning Ishiiruka causes unfixable errors with netplay.
